### Dependencies 
   　 Python3.6
     
   　 PyTorch>=1.0.1
     
   　 torchvision=0.4.2
     
   　 skimage
     
   　 tqdm
   
   
### Quick Start
#### Testing:
Clone this repo in environment that satisfies the prerequisites
Run  test.py using default hyper-parameter settings.
(You can test on the pre-trained model: dehaze_80.pth is the pre-trained meta network, model.pth is the pre-trained dehazing network.)


#### Training:

 Run main.py for training.
